# Crates_and_Barrels
Minetest mod to add crates and barrels for storing items.


Crates have 16 storage blocks and are crafted with four blocks of wood in a square. Barrels have 9 storage blocks and are crafted with 2 vertical blocks of wood.

Right now when dug, the blocks will lose the items stored in them. I'll fix that sometime here.
